== Description ==

ZIP Code Based Content Protection comes in handy when you want the visitor to input ZIP Code before showing them any kind of content. And the content will be shown if that certain ZIP Code is allowed for that particular content.

Situations like when you want to show details of a community meeting, promotions and offers on a certain service, event details etc or any kind of content which the admin wants the user to go through by entering the allowed ZIP Code, ZBCP can assist. 

Below are some salient features:

== ZBCP Features ==

* Simple to use
* 100% responsive
* Can be enabled on all available post types
* Custom message settings
* Can track most requested ZIP Codes
* Custom ZIP Codes
* Track visitor email addresses

As we continue to strive for perfection further features will be added in future updates.
